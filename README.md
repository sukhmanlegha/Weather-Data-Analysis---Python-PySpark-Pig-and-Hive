# Weather-Data-Analysis---Python-PySpark-Pig-and-Hive
This project involves the development of a Python-based data processing application to analyze weather data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) records. In the first part, a Mapper and Reducer application is designed to calculate the average wind direction for each observation month from each year, with specific handling of missing and good-quality values. The second part extends the analysis to PySpark, where a Python application is implemented to determine the range of sky ceiling height for each USAF weather station ID, leveraging the distributed computing capabilities. These tasks contribute to a holistic understanding of weather patterns and conditions over time.

Continuing with the project's scope, the third part introduces a Mapper and Reducer application to extract USAF weather station ID and visibility distance data from NCDC records, subsequently writing this information into a text file. The fourth part shifts the data processing to Pig, where the text file is loaded, and the range of visibility distance for each weather station is calculated. Lastly, the fifth part utilizes Hive to load the text file and compute the average visibility distance for each USAF weather station ID. This multi-step approach showcases the versatility of different tools and frameworks in handling diverse aspects of weather data analysis, providing valuable insights for further research and decision-making.
